# Basics of Computer Networking

Computer networking is the practice of connecting computers and devices to share data and resources. It involves the use of protocols like TCP/IP for communication, hardware such as routers and switches for directing traffic, and various network topologies (e.g., star, mesh, bus) for organizing connections.

Networks can be categorized by size and scope:
- **LAN (Local Area Network)** — small, local environments (e.g., home, office)
- **WAN (Wide Area Network)** — large-scale networks across cities or countries
- **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)** — city-wide networks
- **PAN (Personal Area Network)** — personal devices (e.g., Bluetooth)

**Key concepts:**
- **IP addressing** — identifies devices on a network
- **Subnetting** — divides networks into smaller segments
- **DNS (Domain Name System)** — resolves domain names to IP addresses
- **Routing & Switching** — moving data between networks/devices
- **Network Security** — protecting data and ensuring reliable access

Networking is fundamental for modern IT infrastructure, enabling communication, data sharing, remote access, and cloud computing.
