# Computer Hardware Components

- **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**: The "brain" of the computer that executes instructions and processes data.
- **Motherboard**: Main circuit board connecting CPU, memory, and other components.
- **RAM (Random Access Memory)**: Short-term memory for active data used by the CPU.
- **Storage Devices**:  
  - HDD (Hard Disk Drive): Mechanical storage with moving parts, slower but cheaper.  
  - SSD (Solid-State Drive): Faster, no moving parts, more reliable and expensive.
- **Power Supply Unit (PSU)**: Converts electrical power to usable voltages for components.
- **GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)**: Specialized processor for rendering images, videos, and parallel computations.
- **Input Devices**: Keyboard, mouse, etc.  
- **Output Devices**: Monitor, printer, speakers, etc.

**Key points:**  
- CPU and RAM affect system speed and multitasking ability.  
- SSDs improve boot and load times significantly compared to HDDs.  
- PSU wattage and quality important for system stability.  
- GPUs used not only in gaming but also in machine learning and video editing.
