# Connection Types and Their Function

## Ethernet
- **Type**: Wired (LAN)
- **Speed**: 100 Mbps to 10+ Gbps
- **Pros**: High speed, low latency, very stable
- **Use**: Offices, servers, desktops

## Wi-Fi
- **Type**: Wireless (WLAN)
- **Speed**: Varies (up to several Gbps with Wi-Fi 6/6E)
- **Pros**: Mobility, convenience  
- **Cons**: Signal interference, weaker over distance  
- **Use**: Homes, public places, laptops, mobile devices

## Bluetooth
- **Type**: Short-range wireless
- **Range**: ~10 meters
- **Use**: Peripherals (headphones, keyboards, etc.)
- **Note**: Not used for general networking

## Fiber-Optic
- **Type**: Wired (Fiber)
- **Speed**: Extremely high (up to Tbps)
- **Pros**: Very fast, long-distance, no interference  
- **Cons**: Expensive  
- **Use**: ISP backbones, data centers

# NFC (Near Field Communication)

## Overview
- **Type**: Short-range wireless communication
- **Range**: Up to 4 inches (10 cm)
- **Frequency**: 13.56 MHz
- **Speed**: Up to 424 Kbps
- **Power**: Low power consumption

## Use Cases
- **Contactless payments** (e.g., Apple Pay, Google Pay)
- **Access control** (e.g., door entry systems)
- **Electronic ticketing** (e.g., public transport cards)
- **Quick data exchange** between devices (e.g., sharing contacts or files)

## Modes of Operation
- **Peer-to-Peer Mode**: Two devices exchange data directly (e.g., Android Beam)
- **Card Emulation Mode**: NFC device acts like a smart card (e.g., mobile payments)
- **Reader/Writer Mode**: NFC device reads or writes to NFC tags or cards

## Key Benefits
- **Quick and easy** — minimal setup
- **Secure** — very short range reduces eavesdropping risk
- **Versatile** — used in a wide variety of everyday applications

# Bluetooth Security Overview

## What is Bluetooth?
- **Short-range wireless communication** technology
- Designed for data exchange between fixed and mobile devices
- Common use cases:
  - Wireless headphones, keyboards, mice
  - File transfers
  - IoT device communication

## Security Concerns
Bluetooth can be **exploited as an attack vector** due to:
- Poor device configurations
- Outdated firmware
- Weak protocol implementations

### Common Attack Types
- **Bluejacking**: Sending unsolicited messages to nearby devices
- **Bluesnarfing**: Unauthorized access to data (e.g., contacts, messages)
- **Bluebugging**: Gaining full control over a target device

## Mitigation Measures
To reduce risks:
- Use **latest Bluetooth versions** (e.g., Bluetooth 5.0+)
- **Keep firmware updated**
- **Turn off Bluetooth** when not in use
- **Enable encryption** and avoid untrusted devices
- **Set devices to non-discoverable** mode unless pairing

# WiFi (Wireless Fidelity)

WiFi is a wireless networking technology that allows devices to connect to the internet and communicate without physical cables.

## Key Facts

- **Frequency bands**: 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz (WiFi 6E adds 6 GHz)
- **Standard**: IEEE 802.11 (e.g., 802.11n, 802.11ac, 802.11ax/WiFi 6)
- **Devices**: Laptops, smartphones, smart TVs, IoT devices
- **Components**: Wireless routers, access points, client devices

## Pros

- Cable-free connectivity  
- Easy to set up and expand  
- Good mobility for users

## Cons

- Can be affected by interference  
- Lower reliability and speed than Ethernet  
- Security depends on configuration (WPA2/WPA3 recommended)

## Use Cases

- Home and office networking  
- Public hotspots  
- IoT connectivity  
- BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) environments

# Infrared (IR)

Infrared (IR) is a wireless communication technology that uses light waves in the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum to transmit data.

## Key Facts

- **Medium**: Infrared light (wavelengths ~700 nm to 1 mm)
- **Range**: Short-range (typically < 5 meters)
- **Line-of-sight**: Required — devices must face each other without obstacles

## Common Uses

- Remote controls (TVs, AC units)
- Wireless peripherals (older keyboards, mice)
- Legacy data transfer between computers and printers

## Pros

- Low power consumption  
- No radio frequency (RF) interference  
- Simple implementation

## Cons

- Requires direct line of sight  
- Obstructed easily by objects  
- Limited speed and range

## Modern Relevance

IR is largely replaced by Bluetooth, WiFi, and NFC for most consumer devices but still persists in remote controls and legacy systems.
