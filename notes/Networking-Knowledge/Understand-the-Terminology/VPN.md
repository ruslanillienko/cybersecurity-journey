# VPN

A **Virtual Private Network (VPN)** is a secure technology that allows users to extend private networks across public networks, such as the Internet. It works by creating an **encrypted tunnel** between the user's device and a remote VPN server, ensuring that all data transmitted through this tunnel remains confidential and protected from eavesdropping.

## Key Functions
- **Encryption**: Encrypts data in transit to protect it from interception.
- **IP Masking**: Hides the user’s real IP address by routing traffic through the VPN server.
- **Secure Remote Access**: Allows employees to access corporate networks from remote locations securely.
- **Geo-bypass**: Enables access to region-restricted content by connecting through servers in other locations.

## Common VPN Protocols
- **OpenVPN** – Open-source, highly secure, and widely supported.
- **L2TP/IPsec** – Combines Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol with IPsec encryption.
- **WireGuard** – Modern, fast, and lightweight with strong cryptography.
- **IKEv2/IPsec** – Known for speed and stability, especially on mobile devices.

## Cybersecurity Relevance
VPNs play an important role in:
- **Protecting communications over public Wi-Fi** – Prevents data theft in unsecured environments.
- **Maintaining data integrity** – Ensures that data has not been tampered with during transmission.
- **Defending against man-in-the-middle attacks** – Mitigates risks from malicious actors intercepting traffic.

> **Note**: While VPNs enhance privacy and security, they are not a complete security solution. The level of protection depends on the VPN provider’s policies, logging practices, and technical implementation.
