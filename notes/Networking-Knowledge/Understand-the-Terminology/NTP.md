# NTP (Network Time Protocol)

**Network Time Protocol (NTP)** is a networking protocol designed to synchronize the clocks of computers, servers, and other network devices over an IP-based network. Accurate timekeeping is essential in cybersecurity, as it ensures consistent log timestamps, supports time-sensitive operations, and helps in incident correlation and forensic analysis.

## Key Characteristics
- **Purpose**: Keeps system clocks accurate and consistent across a network.
- **Port**: Operates over **UDP port 123**.
- **Time Sources**: Syncs with highly accurate sources such as atomic clocks, GPS receivers, or other authoritative NTP servers.
- **Accuracy**: Can achieve synchronization within milliseconds over the public internet and even better on local networks.
- **Operation**: Uses algorithms to account for **network latency**, **jitter**, and **clock drift**.

## Importance in Cybersecurity
- **Log Consistency**:  
  Accurate timestamps are critical for correlating logs across multiple systems during **incident response**.
- **Forensic Integrity**:  
  Inconsistent times can undermine the chain of evidence and complicate investigations.
- **Protocol Security**:  
  Many security protocols (e.g., Kerberos) rely on accurate time to prevent replay attacks and ensure token validity.
- **Incident Correlation**:  
  Helps Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools align alerts from multiple systems.

## NTP Security Considerations
- **Authenticated NTP**:  
  Use cryptographic authentication (e.g., NTP Autokey or Network Time Security - NTS) to ensure the legitimacy of the time source.
- **Avoid Public NTP for Sensitive Systems**:  
  Use internal stratum servers to reduce risk from malicious time manipulation.
- **Firewall Configuration**:  
  Limit NTP traffic to trusted sources and block inbound NTP requests from untrusted networks.
- **Monitoring for Abuse**:  
  NTP servers have been used in **DDoS amplification attacks**; disable `monlist` and other legacy commands on public-facing NTP servers.

## Example NTP Hierarchy (Stratum Levels)
1. **Stratum 0** – High-precision reference clocks (e.g., atomic clocks, GPS receivers).
2. **Stratum 1** – Servers directly connected to Stratum 0 devices.
3. **Stratum 2+** – Servers that sync from Stratum 1, cascading to clients.

## Quick Commands
- **Check NTP status on Linux**:  
  ```bash
  ntpq -p
  ```
- **Synchronize time manually**:  
  ```bash
  sudo ntpdate pool.ntp.org
  ```
