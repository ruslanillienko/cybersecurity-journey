# Internet Protocol (IP)

## Overview
**Internet Protocol (IP)** is one of the most fundamental components of network communications and cybersecurity.  
It defines the **rules** for how data is addressed, transmitted, routed, and received across interconnected networks, particularly the internet.

IP is part of the **TCP/IP protocol suite**, which powers almost all modern networking.  
Without IP, devices could not locate or communicate with each other over large-scale networks.

## Key Functions of IP
1. **Addressing**
   - Every device connected to a network is assigned a unique **IP address**.
   - This address serves as the device’s identifier, similar to a mailing address for physical mail.
   - Two main versions exist:
     - **IPv4** – 32-bit format, written as four decimal numbers separated by dots (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).
     - **IPv6** – 128-bit format, written in hexadecimal separated by colons (e.g., `2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334`).

2. **Routing**
   - IP determines the **path** that data packets take from the source to the destination.
   - Routers read the IP header to forward packets toward their final destination.

3. **Encapsulation**
   - Data from higher-level protocols (HTTP, SMTP, FTP, etc.) is wrapped in an IP packet for transmission.

4. **Fragmentation and Reassembly**
   - Large data packets are split into smaller fragments to match network MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) limits.
   - The receiving device reassembles the fragments.

## IPv4 vs IPv6 in Cybersecurity
| Feature           | IPv4                               | IPv6                                         |
|-------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Address size      | 32-bit (≈ 4.3 billion addresses)   | 128-bit (≈ 3.4 × 10³⁸ addresses)              |
| Security features | No built-in encryption             | Native support for **IPsec**                  |
| Notation          | Dotted decimal (e.g., 192.168.0.1) | Hexadecimal with colons (e.g., 2001:db8::1)   |

**IPv6** was designed with modern cybersecurity needs in mind, supporting:
- **Built-in IPsec** for encryption and authentication.
- Improved resistance to some address spoofing attacks.

## IP in the Context of Cybersecurity
From a security perspective, IP is a critical point of control and attack:
- **Attack Surface**
  - IP spoofing (for hiding attacker identity)
  - Denial-of-Service (DoS) or Distributed DoS attacks targeting IP addresses
  - IP-based reconnaissance (scanning networks for open ports and vulnerabilities)

- **Defensive Measures**
  - Firewalls filter traffic based on IP addresses and protocols.
  - Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) monitor suspicious IP patterns.
  - Access Control Lists (ACLs) restrict traffic to trusted IP ranges.
  - IP reputation services block known malicious IP addresses.

## Example: IP in Action
When you visit a website:
1. Your device sends a request containing your **source IP** to the site’s **destination IP**.
2. Routers along the way read the IP headers and forward the packet.
3. The server responds, sending data back to your IP.
