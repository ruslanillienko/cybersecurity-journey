# Common Protocols and Their Uses

Networking protocols are essential for facilitating communication between devices and systems across networks. In cybersecurity, understanding these protocols is crucial for identifying potential vulnerabilities and securing data transmission.

## Key Protocols and Their Roles

### 1. **TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol)**
- **Use**: Foundation of internet communication
- **Purpose**: Ensures reliable data transmission between devices

### 2. **HTTP / HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol / Secure)**
- **Use**: Web browsing and web communication
- **HTTPS**: Adds TLS/SSL encryption for secure communication

### 3. **FTP / SFTP (File Transfer Protocol / Secure FTP)**
- **Use**: Transferring files between hosts
- **SFTP**: Adds encryption and secure authentication

### 4. **SMTP, POP3, IMAP**
- **Use**: Email communication
- **SMTP**: Sending emails
- **POP3**: Retrieving emails from a server (downloads and deletes)
- **IMAP**: Retrieving and managing emails on the server

### 5. **DNS (Domain Name System)**
- **Use**: Resolves domain names into IP addresses

### 6. **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**
- **Use**: Automatically assigns IP addresses and network configurations to devices

### 7. **SSH (Secure Shell)**
- **Use**: Secure remote access and administration

### 8. **TLS/SSL (Transport Layer Security / Secure Sockets Layer)**
- **Use**: Encrypts communication over networks (e.g., HTTPS, email)

### 9. **SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)**
- **Use**: Network monitoring and management

### 10. **VPN Protocols (e.g., IPsec, OpenVPN, WireGuard)**
- **Use**: Secure and private remote network access

Cybersecurity professionals must be well-versed in these protocols to effectively:
- Monitor and analyse network traffic
- Implement proper security configurations
- Detect and mitigate attacks that exploit protocol weaknesses
