# Basics of NAS and SAN

**Network Attached Storage (NAS)** and **Storage Area Network (SAN)** are two fundamental technologies used for network-based data storage. While they both provide centralized storage solutions, they differ significantly in architecture, performance, and use cases.

## What is NAS?

**Network Attached Storage (NAS)** is a dedicated file storage device connected to a standard network (LAN). It allows multiple clients and devices to access shared files using common file-level protocols.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Operates at the file level**
- Uses protocols like **NFS**, **SMB/CIFS**
- Accessible over TCP/IP networks
- Appears as a shared folder or mapped network drive

### Pros:
- Easy to set up and manage
- Ideal for file sharing, backups, media streaming
- Cost-effective for SMBs and home users

### Cons:
- Not optimized for high-performance workloads
- Limited scalability and performance compared to SAN

## What is SAN?

**Storage Area Network (SAN)** is a high-speed network that provides **block-level** access to storage. It is typically used in enterprise environments requiring fast and scalable data access.

### üîß Key Characteristics:
- **Operates at the block level**
- Uses protocols like **Fibre Channel**, **iSCSI**, **FCoE**
- Appears as a local disk to the operating system
- Requires a separate, dedicated storage network

### Pros:
- High performance and low latency
- Scalable and ideal for virtualization, databases
- Centralized storage management for multiple servers

### Cons:
- Expensive to deploy and maintain
- Requires specialized hardware and skills

| Feature              | NAS                                | SAN                                  |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Access Type          | File-level                         | Block-level                           |
| Protocols            | SMB, NFS, FTP                      | Fibre Channel, iSCSI, FCoE            |
| Use Case             | File sharing, backups              | Databases, virtualization, large apps |
| Appearance to Host   | Shared folders                     | Local disk                            |
| Performance          | Moderate                           | High                                  |
| Setup Complexity     | Simple                             | Complex                               |

## Summary

- **NAS** is ideal for shared file access, backups, and SMB/home environments.
- **SAN** is best suited for high-performance applications in enterprise settings.

Each has its place in the data center, and the right choice depends on **performance**, **scalability**, and **budget requirements**.
