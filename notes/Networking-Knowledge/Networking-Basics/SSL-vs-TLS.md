# SSL vs TLS

**Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)** and **Transport Layer Security (TLS)** are cryptographic protocols used to secure communication over networks, especially the internet. These protocols ensure **confidentiality**, **integrity**, and **authentication** of the transmitted data — critical for online activities such as login, email, and financial transactions.

## Core Security Goals

| Goal               | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| Confidentiality | Encrypts data between client and server to prevent eavesdropping. |
| Integrity        | Ensures data has not been tampered with in transit. |
| Authentication   | Verifies the identity of the communicating parties. |

## SSL vs TLS: Key Differences

| Feature             | SSL                                 | TLS                                      |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Status              | **Deprecated**                       | **Current standard**                      |
| Latest Version      | SSL 3.0 (1996)                       | TLS 1.3 (2018)                            |
| Browser Support     | No longer supported                  | Supported by all modern browsers          |
| Security            | Known vulnerabilities (e.g., POODLE)| Considered secure                         |
| Performance         | Slower                              | Faster and more efficient                 |
| Cryptography        | Uses outdated algorithms             | Uses modern, stronger encryption methods  |

## Why SSL is No Longer Used

- **Vulnerabilities** like POODLE and BEAST.
- **Obsolete cryptography** and insecure cipher suites.
- **Disabled in modern browsers** and server software.
- **Non-compliant with security standards** such as PCI-DSS.

---

## Why TLS is Preferred

- TLS 1.2 and 1.3 use strong encryption (e.g., AEAD, ECC).
- Better performance and reduced latency (especially in TLS 1.3).
- Required for secure HTTP (HTTPS), email, VPN, and other protocols.
- Actively maintained and improved by the IETF.

---

## Common Uses of TLS

- **HTTPS** – Secure websites (`https://`)
- **SMTPS / IMAPS / POP3S** – Secure email protocols
- **FTPS / SFTP** – Secure file transfer
- **VPNs** – Secure encrypted tunnels (e.g., OpenVPN, IPsec)

---

## Best Practices

- Always **disable SSL** in server configurations.
- **Use TLS 1.3** wherever possible.
- Obtain certificates from **trusted Certificate Authorities (CA)**.
- Test your TLS configuration using tools like [SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/).
