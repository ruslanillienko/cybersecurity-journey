# Networking Knowledge

Networking knowledge is fundamental for anyone working in IT and cybersecurity. It involves understanding how data travels between devices, how networks are structured, and how they are secured. Below are the core areas to master:

---

## Network Protocols

Protocols define the rules for data exchange across a network. Some essential ones include:

- **TCP/IP** – The foundation of internet communication.
- **DNS (Domain Name System)** – Resolves human-readable domain names to IP addresses.
- **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)** – Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices.
- **HTTP/HTTPS** – Protocols used for accessing web content, with HTTPS providing encryption.

---

## Network Topologies

Network topology refers to the layout of connected devices. Common types:

- **Star** – Devices connect to a central hub or switch.
- **Ring** – Devices form a closed loop; data travels in one direction.
- **Mesh** – Each device connects directly to others for redundancy.
- **Hybrid** – Combines multiple topology types for scalability and resilience.

## IP Addressing and Subnetting

Understanding how networks are logically divided is key:

- **IPv4 & IPv6** – Addressing schemes used to identify devices.
- **Subnetting** – Splits networks into smaller segments to improve efficiency and security.
- **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)** – Provides flexible IP allocation (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`).

## Network Devices

Each device in a network plays a specific role:

- **Router** – Directs traffic between different networks.
- **Switch** – Connects devices within the same network segment.
- **Firewall** – Filters traffic based on rules to protect against threats.
- **Access Point** – Enables wireless connectivity within a network.

---

## Network Security

Security is a critical part of networking:

- **VPN (Virtual Private Network)** – Encrypts traffic between endpoints.
- **Firewall** – Blocks or permits traffic based on security policies.
- **IDS/IPS** – Detects or prevents malicious network activity.
- **Encryption** – Secures data in transit using protocols like SSL/TLS.

---

## Troubleshooting

Diagnosing and resolving network issues requires effective tools:

- `ping` – Tests basic connectivity.
- `traceroute` / `tracert` – Maps the path packets take to a destination.
- **Wireshark** – Captures and analyzes network traffic.
- **Nmap** – Scans networks to discover hosts and open ports.

## Summary

Mastering these concepts enables you to:

- Design secure and scalable networks  
- Understand how communication flows between systems  
- Troubleshoot connectivity issues efficiently  
- Protect infrastructure from network-based attacks
