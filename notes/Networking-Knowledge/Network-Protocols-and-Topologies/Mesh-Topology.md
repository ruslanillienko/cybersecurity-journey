# Mesh Topology

A **mesh topology** is a network architecture where devices (nodes) are interconnected with multiple direct, point-to-point links to every other node in the network. This provides **redundancy, reliability, and fault tolerance**.

---

## Types of Mesh Topology
- **Full Mesh** – every node is connected to every other node.  
- **Partial Mesh** – only critical nodes have multiple connections, reducing cost and complexity.  

---

## Key Characteristics
- **Multiple paths** – data can be rerouted if a link fails.  
- **High redundancy** – resilient to failures.  
- **Expensive to implement** – requires large number of cables and ports in wired setups.  
- **Complex management** – especially in large-scale deployments.  

---

## Advantages
- **Fault tolerance** – if one link fails, traffic can take alternative routes.  
- **High availability** – robust design suitable for critical systems.  
- **No single point of failure** – unlike star or ring topologies.  
- **Scalability in wireless** – mesh wireless networks self-heal and adapt dynamically.  

---

## Disadvantages
- **Costly in wired setups** – requires a large number of links and network interfaces.  
- **Complex configuration** – routing and management become difficult in large networks.  
- **Resource-intensive** – more bandwidth and processing power needed for routing decisions.

## Security Perspective
From a **cybersecurity** perspective, mesh topologies offer **both strengths and risks**:

### Strengths
- **Resilience against DoS** – multiple paths make denial-of-service harder to succeed.  
- **Decentralization** – no central hub to target.  
- **Dynamic rerouting** – harder for attackers to disrupt traffic flow entirely.  

### Risks
- **Increased attack surface** – more connections mean more points to secure.  
- **Compromised node risk** – if one node is hacked, it can intercept or manipulate traffic.  
- **Complex key management** – securing many peer-to-peer links is challenging.  

---

## Best Practices for Security
- **Encrypt all traffic** (TLS, VPNs) to protect against interception.  
- **Use strong authentication** between nodes (certificates, keys).  
- **Regular patching** of all devices to reduce vulnerability exposure.  
- **Implement intrusion detection** at multiple nodes to catch anomalies.  
- **Limit trust** – apply Zero Trust principles so no single node has full control.  

---

## Common Use Cases
- **Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs)** – used in smart cities, IoT, disaster recovery.  
- **Military and critical infrastructure** – reliability and redundancy are vital.  
- **Data center interconnects** – partial mesh ensures high performance and resilience.  
- **Blockchain & P2P applications** – conceptually similar in decentralized communication.  

---

**Summary:**  
Mesh topology provides **high redundancy, resilience, and fault tolerance**, making it ideal for **critical systems and wireless environments**. However, it is **expensive and complex** in wired setups, and securing many peer-to-peer connections requires strong encryption, authentication, and monitoring.
