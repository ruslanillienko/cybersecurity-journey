# Ring Topology

A **ring topology** is a network configuration where each device (node) is connected to exactly two other devices, forming a **circular data path**. Data travels through each node in one direction (unidirectional) or both directions (bidirectional) until it reaches its destination.

---

## Key Characteristics
- **Circular structure** – each device has two connections (one upstream, one downstream).  
- **Data flow** – travels in one or both directions depending on configuration.  
- **Dependency** – a single point of failure (node or cable) can disrupt communication.  
- **Deterministic path** – data follows a predictable route, reducing collisions.  

---

## Advantages
- **Efficient use of bandwidth** – predictable path reduces chances of packet collisions.  
- **Simple installation** – less cabling compared to star topology.  
- **Fairness in transmission** – each node gets equal access to the network (important in token ring).  

---

## Disadvantages
- **Single failure can break the network** – unless redundancy is built in (dual ring).  
- **Difficult troubleshooting** – locating a failed node may take time.  
- **Scalability issues** – adding/removing nodes disrupts the ring.  
- **Obsolete in modern networks** – largely replaced by star-based Ethernet.

## Security Perspective
From a **cybersecurity** standpoint, ring topology presents unique challenges:

### Strengths
- **Traffic predictability** – since data travels in order, monitoring is more structured.  
- **Token-based systems (Token Ring)** – reduce chances of packet injection and collisions.  

### Risks
- **Single point of attack** – compromise of one node can disrupt or intercept all traffic.  
- **Eavesdropping risk** – each node sees data passing through it, enabling sniffing.  
- **Weak redundancy** – unless dual-ring is used, DoS attacks are easy to execute.  

---

## Best Practices for Security
- **Use redundancy (dual-ring)** to reduce impact of node failures.  
- **Encrypt traffic** (VPN, TLS) to protect against packet sniffing at intermediate nodes.  
- **Apply strict access control** on nodes to prevent malicious devices from joining.  
- **Implement monitoring** to detect abnormal traffic flows or interruptions.  

---

## Common Use Cases
- **Legacy LANs** – IBM Token Ring networks (historical).  
- **Telecommunication backbones** – SONET/SDH use ring topologies with redundancy.  
- **Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs)** – sometimes use ring-based fiber structures.  

---

**Summary:**  
Ring topology provides **deterministic data flow** but is highly vulnerable to **failures and attacks** due to its dependency on each node. Modern networks rarely use it, but concepts from ring topologies still influence **telecom and backbone architectures** today.
