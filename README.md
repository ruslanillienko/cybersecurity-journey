# My Journey to Cybersecurity Professional

This repository is my personal project for systematic learning of cybersecurity, following the official [roadmap.sh/cyber-security](https://roadmap.sh/cyber-security).

The goal of this project is to build solid foundational knowledge, track my progress, and create a portfolio of notes, labs, and insights gained along the way.

## Project Goals

- Master key topics and skills in cybersecurity  
- Maintain a clear and concise progress journal with regular updates  
- Utilize external resources (videos, courses, AI tools) for deeper understanding  
- Build a transparent portfolio showcasing acquired knowledge and practical skills

## About Me

I am starting this learning journey from the very beginning of the cybersecurity roadmap.  
Since 2022, I have been working as a network engineer focused on cybersecurity.  
I hold a Bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity and a Master's degree in Software Engineering.  
This project aims to systematize my existing knowledge and deepen my understanding of cybersecurity concepts in English, because most of my previous experience and education are in Ukrainian.
